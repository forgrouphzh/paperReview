This is achieved by solving a static Schr\u00f6dinger equation instead of the corresponding static Hamilton-Jacobi equation in this setting. The SDT representation is an analytic expression and following the theoretical physics literature, can be normalized to have unit L2 norm-making it a square-root density, which is identified with a point on a unit Hilbert sphere, whose intrinsic geometry is fully known. The Fisher-Rao metric, a natural metric for the space of densities leads to analytic expressions for the geodesic distance between points on this sphere. In this paper, we use the well known Riemannian framework never before used for point cloud matching, and present a novel matching algorithm. We pose point set matching under rigid and non-rigid transformations in this framework and solve for the transformations using standard nonlinear optimization techniques. Finally, to evaluate the performance of our algorithm-dubbed SDTM-we present several synthetic and real data examples along with extensive comparisons to state-of-the-art techniques.

In particular there are three areas of novelty: (i) we show how a photometric model of image formation can be combined with a statistical model of generic face appearance variation, learnt offline, to generalize in the presence of extreme illumination changes; (ii) we use the smoothness of geodesically local appearance manifold structure and a robust same-identity likelihood to achieve invariance to unseen head poses; and (iii) we introduce an accurate video sequence \" reillumination \" algorithm to achieve robustness to face motion patterns in video. We describe a fully automatic recognition system based on the proposed method and an extensive evaluation on 171 individuals and over 1300 video sequences with extreme illumination, pose and head motion variation.

Our core motivation is that minimizing a weighted rank loss is a natural criterion for many problems in computer vision such as person re-identification. We propose a novel metric learning formulation called Weighted Approximate Rank Component Analysis (WARCA). We then derive a scalable stochastic gradient descent algorithm for the resulting learning problem. We also derive an efficient non-linear extension of WARCA by using the kernel trick. Kernel space embedding decouples the training and prediction costs from the data dimension and enables us to plug inarbitrary distance measures which are more natural for the features. We also address a more general problem of matrix rank degeneration & non-isolated minima in the low-rank matrix optimization by using new type of regularizer which approximately enforces the or-thonormality of the learned matrix very efficiently.

The motivation for this work is to develop a testbed for image sequence description systems, where the task is to generate natural language descriptions for animated GIFs or video clips. To ensure a high quality dataset, we developed a series of novel quality controls to validate free-form text input from crowd-workers. We show that there is unambiguous association between visual content and natural language descriptions in our dataset, making it an ideal benchmark for the visual content captioning task. We perform extensive statistical analyses to compare our dataset to existing image and video description datasets.

SVC makes it possible to convert singing voice characteristics of an arbitrary source singer into those of an arbitrary target singer. However, speech quality of the converted singing voice is significantly degraded compared to that of a natural singing voice due to various factors, such as analysis and modeling errors in the vocoder-based framework. To alleviate this degradation, we propose a statistical conversion process that directly modifies the signal in the waveform domain by estimating the difference in the spectra of the source and target singers' singing voices. The differential spectral feature is directly estimated using a differential Gaussian mixture model (GMM) that is analytically derived from the traditional GMM used as a conversion model in the conventional SVC. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method makes it possible to significantly improve speech quality in the converted singing voice while preserving the conversion accuracy of singer identity compared to the conventional SVC.", "output": null}, {"instruction": "Please extract the key words of this abstract as many as possible and tell me what kind of entity they are", "input": " \n We introduce a new  interactive corpus exploration tool  called  InfoMagnets  .

Moreover, a heuristic approach was commonly used to obtain translation invariance. In this paper we suggest an improved approach for learning such models and using them for human motion recognition. The suggested approach combines multiple cues, i.e., positions, velocities and appearance into both the learning and detection phases. Furthermore, we introduce global variables in the model, which can represent global properties such as translation, scale or viewpoint. The model is learned in an unsupervised manner from un-labelled data. We show that the suggested hybrid proba-bilistic model (which combines global variables, like translation , with local variables, like relative positions and appearances of body parts), leads to: (i) faster convergence of learning phase, (ii) robustness to occlusions, and, (iii) higher recognition rate.", "output": null}, {"instruction": "Please extract the key words of this abstract as many as possible and tell me what kind of entity they are", "input": "Joint matrix triangularization is often used for estimating the joint eigenstructure of a set M of matrices, with applications in signal processing and machine learning.

Our main result is a first-order upper bound on the distance between any approximate joint triangularizer of the matrices in M' and any exact joint triangularizer of the matrices in M. The bound depends only on the observable matrices in M' and the noise level. In particular, it does not depend on optimization specific properties of the triangularizer, such as its proximity to critical points, that are typical of existing bounds in the literature.
