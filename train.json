We show the effectiveness of the latter by measuring and comparing performance on the automatic transcriptions of an English corpus collected from TED talks.

To guarantee detection sensitivity and accuracy of minute changes, in an observation, we capture a group of images under multiple illuminations, which need only to be roughly aligned to the last time lighting conditions. Given two times observations, we formulate fine-grained change detection as a joint optimization problem of three related factors, i.e., normal-aware lighting difference, camera geometry correction flow, and real scene change mask. We solve the three factors in a coarse-to-fine manner and achieve reliable change decision by rank minimization. We build three real-world datasets to benchmark fine-grained change detection of misaligned scenes under varied multiple lighting conditions.

Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting.

Owing to these variations, the pedestrian data is distributed as highly-curved manifolds in the feature space, despite the current convolutional neural networks (CNN)'s capability of feature extraction. However, the distribution is unknown, so it is difficult to use the geodesic distance when comparing two samples. In practice, the current deep embedding methods use the Euclidean distance for the training and test. On the other hand, the manifold learning methods suggest to use the Euclidean distance in the local range, combining with the graphical relationship between samples , for approximating the geodesic distance. From this point of view, selecting suitable positive (i.e. intra-class) training samples within a local range is critical for training the CNN embedding, especially when the data has large intra-class variations.

Experiments show that these two strategies are effective in learning robust deep metrics for person re-identification, and accordingly our deep model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks of person re-identification.

Conventional non-rigid surface tracking performs frame-to-frame alignment which is subject to the accumulation of errors resulting in a drift over time. Recently, non-sequential tracking approaches have been introduced which reorder the input data based on a dissimilarity measure. One or more input sequences are represented in a tree with reduced alignment path length. They demonstrate a reduced drift and increased robustness to large non-rigid deformations. However, jumps may occur in the aligned mesh sequence where branches of the tree meet due to different error accumulation along them. Optimisation of the tree for non-sequential tracking, which minimises the errors in temporal consistency due to both the drift and the jumps, is proposed. A novel cluster tree enforces sequential tracking in local segments of the sequence while allowing global non-sequential traversal among these segments. This provides a mechanism to create a tree structure which reduces the number and size of jumps between branches and limits the lenght of branches as well. Comprehensive evaluation is performed on a variety of challenging non-rigid surfaces including face, cloth and people. It demonstrates that the proposed cluster tree achieves better temporal consistency than the previous sequential and non-sequential tracking approaches.

Such knowledge comes either from domain experts based on their experience or from various physical or geometric constraints that govern the objects we try to model.

Recently considerable progress has been made by a number of groups involved in the  DARPA Spoken Language Systems (SLS) program  to agree on a methodology for comparative evaluation of  SLS systems , and that methodology has been put into practice several times in comparative tests of several  SLS systems .

We formulate the proposal generation problem as a generative proba-bilistic model such that object proposals of different shapes (i.e., sizes and orientations) can be produced by locating the local maximum likelihoods. The new approach has three main advantages. First, it helps the object detector handle objects of different orientations. Second, as the shapes of the proposals may vary to fit the objects, the resulting proposals are tighter than the sampling windows with fixed sizes. Third, it avoids massive window sampling, and thereby reducing the number of proposals while maintaining a high recall. Experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset show that the proposed OOP outperforms the state-of-the-art fast methods. Further experiments show that the rotation invariant property helps a class-specific object detector achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art proposal generation methods in either object rotation scenarios or general scenarios.

In this way, we can make blurring locally adaptive to the image data, reducing noise but retaining object boundaries, obtaining superior localization accuracy and distinctiviness.

Building such a representation requires the capability to register all the frames with respect to the dominant object in the scene, a task which has been, in the past, addressed through temporally localized motion estimates. In this paper, we show how the lack of temporal consistency associated with such estimates can undermine the validity of the dominant motion assumption, leading to oscillation between different scene interpretations and poor registration. To avoid this oscillation, we augment the motion model with a generic temporal constraint which increases the robustness against competing interpretations, leading to more meaningful content summarization.", "output": null}, {"instruction": "Please extract the key words of this abstract as many as possible and tell me what kind of entity they are", "input": " In order to boost the  translation quality  of  EBMT  based on a small-sized  bilingual corpus  , we use an out-of-domain  bilingual corpus  and, in addition, the  language model  of an in-domain  monolingual corpus  .

Understanding natural images has been extensively studied in computer vision, while diagram understanding has received little attention. In this paper, we study the problem of diagram interpretation and reasoning, the challenging task of identifying the structure of a diagram and the semantics of its constituents and their relationships. We introduce Diagram Parse Graphs (DPG) as our representation to model the structure of diagrams. We define syntactic parsing of diagrams as learning to infer DPGs for diagrams and study semantic interpretation and reasoning of diagrams in the context of diagram question answering. We devise an LSTM-based method for syntactic parsing of diagrams and introduce a DPG-based attention model for diagram question answering. We compile a new dataset of diagrams with exhaustive annotations of constituents and relationships for over 5,000 diagrams and 15,000 questions and answers.

Basically, a set of age-group specific dictionaries are learned, where the dictionary bases corresponding to the same index yet from different dictionaries form a particular aging process pattern cross different age groups, and a linear combination of these patterns expresses a particular personalized aging process. Moreover, two factors are taken into consideration in the dictionary learning process. First, beyond the aging dictionaries, each subject may have extra personalized facial characteristics, e.g. mole, which are invariant in the aging process. Second, it is challenging or even impossible to collect faces of all age groups for a particular subject, yet much easier and more practical to get face pairs from neighboring age groups. Thus a personality-aware coupled reconstruction loss is utilized to learn the dictionaries based on face pairs from neighboring age groups. Extensive experiments well demonstrate the advantages of our proposed solution over other state-of-the-arts in term of personalized aging progression, as well as the performance gain for cross-age face verification by synthesizing aging faces.", "output": null}, {"instruction": "Please extract the key words of this abstract as many as possible and tell me what kind of entity they are", "input": "We present a novel algorithm for estimating the broad 3D geometric structure of outdoor video scenes. Leveraging spatio-temporal video segmentation, we decompose a dynamic scene captured by a video into geometric classes, based on predictions made by region-classifiers that are trained on appearance and motion features. By examining the homogeneity of the prediction, we combine predictions across multiple segmentation hierarchy levels alleviating the need to determine the granularity a priori. We built a novel, extensive dataset on geometric context of video to evaluate our method, consisting of over 100 ground-truth annotated outdoor videos with over 20,000 frames. To further scale beyond this dataset, we propose a semi-supervised learning framework to expand the pool of labeled data with high confidence predictions obtained from unlabeled data.
